  <li>By donating leftovers or using ingredients efficiently, the shop can help reduce food waste, contributing to better food system sustainability.</li>
  <li>When someone orders food, they can buy an extra meal and leave the receipt on our special board. Each receipt is basically a prepaid meal. A person in need can simply walk in, take a receipt from the board, and get a hot mealâ€”no questions asked.</li>

  <li>Our franchise taxes customers who waste food. For example, for every 100g of food wastage, we tax the customers RM10. This helps encourage customers to take away food or to finish their food to prevent being taxed.</li>
  <li>We take left over food and provide them to farmers. Farmers can use these food wastage and feed them to the pigs. The pig manure is then used as compost.</li>
	<li>We also keep some of the more moldy food in a storage bin, as pigs are unable to eat moldy food. The moldy food is kept until there are no more storage space, then it's grinded into a composter. The grinded food is given to farmers to use as compost.</li>
